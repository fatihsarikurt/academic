excerpt: 'The present work illustrates one example of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) application in the nuclear engineering field. Since CFD is one of the most powerful tools available at the actual state of the art that could in principle help and assist the design process, a compromise should be established between the accuracy of the CFD numerical model (RANS - LES - DNS) and the computational cost of the simulations. In this spirit, this work will present the computational results from two different CFD model categories, Large Eddy Simulations (LES) and Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models. Both treat the flow turbulence issue in two separate ways, which differ mostly in the resolution of the turbulence statistics and the computational cost. The single-phase hydraulic problem presented involves the steady-state turbulent flow field modelling and resolution around a scaled PWR mixing vane grid, designed by Westinghouse and tested by Texas A and M University. The role of the mixing vane/spacer grid is to enhance the turbulent mixing and hence heat transfer of the core coolant around fuel bundles, thus increasing the departure of nucleate boiling-critical heat flux (DNB-CHF) point, as well as important structural functions for the rods bundles'
