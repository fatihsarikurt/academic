excerpt: 'Uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods can be applied to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations for determining the uncertainty bands of the simulations results. In order to determine the applicability of these different methods, simple benchmark activities have been conducted by various group for comparison. The GEMIX (Generic Mixing experiment) test facility was used to develop benchmark data for this purpose by the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI). The facility involves the mixing of two fluids that are initially separated. One of the two fluids is water with sugar dissolved in it to create a fluid with similar fluid properties to water, except for density. The other fluid was distilled water to reduce the uncertainty in the fluid&apos;s properties. During the experiments, velocity fields and concentration measurements were acquired at several planes of interest. The velocity fields were acquired using particle image velocimetry (PIV) and concentrations of each fluid were acquired using laser induced fluorescence (LIF). The inlet velocity profiles were acquired using laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV). The activity provided the opportunity to vary turbulence models, meshing methodologies, and numerical schemes for creation of uncertainty estimates. The present study investigates the usage of a simple Monte Carlo (MC) technique for varying the inlet boundary conditions of each inlet. The velocity profiles and densities of each inlet were specifically varied based on experiment measurement uncertainty. The intent was to isolate the uncertainty due to inlet quantities and not related to meshing, numerical scheme, or turbulence models'
