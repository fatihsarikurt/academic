excerpt: 'In this work we studied the sensitivity of different computational fluid dynamics (CFD) numerical solutions on turbulence model, domain discretization mesh type, and inlet boundary conditions. The case under examination is a turbulent one-phase flow (water) through a scaled nuclear pressurized water reactor (PWR) fuel assembly. The main feature of this geometrical configuration is the presence of a spacer grid with mixing vanes'
