excerpt: 'The work presented in this article is preliminary to downstream analysis of a generic fluoride salt-cooled high-temperature reactor (gFHR) core performed by the University of Tennessee in collaboration with Kairos Power (KP). A Monte Carlo transport model of the publicly available gFHR equilibrium core is developed in SCALE/KENO with multigroup energy treatment'
