2017-06-11	A non-linear k-{epsilon} turbulent model sensitivity analysis for flow across a PWR spacer grid with mixing vanes	ANS Annual Meeting 2017, San Francisco, CA	In this work we studied the sensitivity of different computational fluid dynamics (CFD) numerical solutions on turbulence model, domain discretization mesh type, and inlet boundary conditions. The case under examination is a turbulent one-phase flow (water) through a scaled nuclear pressurized water reactor (PWR) fuel assembly. The main feature of this geometrical configuration is the presence of a spacer grid with mixing vanes	cite	non-linear-k-epsilon-model-pwr-mixing-vanes	https://www.osti.gov/biblio/23050407
2017-06-11	Toward High Fidelity LES Simulations of 5 x 5 PWR Fuel Bundle with Mixing Vane	ANS Annual Meeting 2017, San Francisco, CA	The present work illustrates one example of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) application in the nuclear engineering field. Since CFD is one of the most powerful tools available at the actual state of the art that could in principle help and assist the design process, a compromise should be established between the accuracy of the CFD numerical model (RANS - LES - DNS) and the computational cost of the simulations. In this spirit, this work will present the computational results from two different CFD model categories, Large Eddy Simulations (LES) and Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models. Both treat the flow turbulence issue in two separate ways, which differ mostly in the resolution of the turbulence statistics and the computational cost. The single-phase hydraulic problem presented involves the steady-state turbulent flow field modelling and resolution around a scaled PWR mixing vane grid, designed by Westinghouse and tested by Texas A and M University. The role of the mixing vane/spacer grid is to enhance the turbulent mixing and hence heat transfer of the core coolant around fuel bundles, thus increasing the departure of nucleate boiling-critical heat flux (DNB-CHF) point, as well as important structural functions for the rods bundles	cite	high-fidelity-les-model-pwr-mixing-vanes	https://www.osti.gov/biblio/23050420
2016-11-06	Uncertainty Quantification by Monte Carlo Analysis using CFD Simulations for GEMIX Benchmark Activities	ANS Winter Meeting 2016, Las Vegas, NV	Uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods can be applied to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations for determining the uncertainty bands of the simulations results. In order to determine the applicability of these different methods, simple benchmark activities have been conducted by various group for comparison. The GEMIX (Generic Mixing experiment) test facility was used to develop benchmark data for this purpose by the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI). The facility involves the mixing of two fluids that are initially separated. One of the two fluids is water with sugar dissolved in it to create a fluid with similar fluid properties to water, except for density. The other fluid was distilled water to reduce the uncertainty in the fluid's properties. During the experiments, velocity fields and concentration measurements were acquired at several planes of interest. The velocity fields were acquired using particle image velocimetry (PIV) and concentrations of each fluid were acquired using laser induced fluorescence (LIF). The inlet velocity profiles were acquired using laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV). The activity provided the opportunity to vary turbulence models, meshing methodologies, and numerical schemes for creation of uncertainty estimates. The present study investigates the usage of a simple Monte Carlo (MC) technique for varying the inlet boundary conditions of each inlet. The velocity profiles and densities of each inlet were specifically varied based on experiment measurement uncertainty. The intent was to isolate the uncertainty due to inlet quantities and not related to meshing, numerical scheme, or turbulence models	cite	uq-cfd-monte-carlo-gemix	https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309913924_Uncertainty_Quantification_by_Monte_Carlo_Analysis_using_CFD_Simulations_for_GEMIX_Benchmark_Activities
