Hi! I'm a Principal Engineer in Thermal Hydraulics at TerraPower, and I've been working in the field for over 13 years. My expertise lies in high-fidelity CFD applications, multiphysics, and multiscale modeling of nuclear reactor systems. I hold a Ph.D. and M.Sc. in Nuclear Engineering from Texas A&M University and a Bachelor of Science in Nuclear Engineering from Hacettepe University, where I had the honor of graduating as the top student in my class.

Throughout my career, I have made significant contributions to the industry, including:

- Developing the 3D Sodium-cooled Natrium fast reactor CFD modeling methodology to support the CPA licensing application

- Establishing the infrastructure and procedures to modify the Relap5-3D transient analysis tool for compatibility with Sodium fast reactors and establishing NQA-1 development procedures at TerraPower

- Authoring critical reports for the licensing application of the Hermes Test Reactor at Kairos Power, which is the first approved non-light water reactor license application in the USA by the NRC in more than 50 years

- Pioneering a novel approach to model explicit fuel burn-up in pebble bed reactors

- Developing the KPATH tool for the coupled analysis of thermal hydraulics and neutronics of the pebble bed nuclear reactor

My research experience at Texas A&M University and Hacettepe University has honed my skills in leveraging cutting-edge tools such as Star CCM+, ANSYS Fluent, OpenFOAM, NekRS, ANSYS Mechanic, Serpent, MCNP, and OpenMC.

As an active member of the ASME V&V-UQ standard committee, the ANS 53.1 committee, and a referee for multiple scientific journals, I am committed to advancing the field of nuclear engineering.
